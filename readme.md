**Current Progress:**

*   **Smart Contract Core Logic (Splitter.sol):**
    *   Group creation with member management (on-chain wallet addresses).
    *   Functionality for adding expenses with equitable division among group members.
    *   Mechanism for tracking debts directly between members within each group.
    *   Secure debt settlement process using Mantle's native MNT token (payable functions, direct MNT transfers).
    *   Implementation of Ownable pattern for administrative controls.
    *   Event emissions for key actions (GroupCreated, ExpenseAdded, DebtPaid) to facilitate frontend updates.
*   **Development Environment & Deployment:**
    *   Hardhat environment configured for Solidity smart contract development.
    *   Successful deployment of the `Splitter` contract to the **Mantle Sepolia 
*   **Frontend Progress:**
    *  Completed implementation of the three main user flows:
    *   Creating a group
    *   Adding an expense
    *   Paying a debt
    *   Full transition from Figma design to a responsive Next.js frontend.
    *   Functional login and navigation across all available pages.


**Next Steps (Remaining 50%):**

*   **Automation & Advanced Features:**
    *   Integrate Gelato to enable automated recurring payments (e.g., splitting and scheduling monthly payments for shared services like Netflix).
    *   Explore a new group balance feature to allow debt settlement through a single aggregated transaction rather than individual payments to each member.
